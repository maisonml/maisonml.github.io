  In **Season 1 of Maison ML**, our focus is on **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms**. We have 9 chapters in season 1 and under each chapter, we will learn about the most frequently used supervised ML aglorithms: XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, k- Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Linear Regression and Ensembling. This season will cover both **Regression and Classification** algorithms. The algorithms are explained with the underlying math, code to implement them and an practical example using publicly available data.
