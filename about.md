## About Maison ML

**Maison ML** was founded by Dhivya Ravindran to serve as an everyday reference of data intense daily situation reports on the onset, progression and updates of the **2019- 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic**. The reports are updated everyday by 10.00 AM ET/ 7.00 AM PT with the previous day's data. If you would like additional metrics added to this report or would like further features added to this product, please send out an email to dhivyaravindran@gmail.com.

The following are the product enhancements upcoming in the pipeline:

> TBD

The following were the changes made to the reports and/or product over time sorted from new to old:

> **Important:** JHU made the following update: *We want to make everyone aware of another update to the release schedule for the daily products.
We are moving the update time forward to occur between 04:45 and 05:15 GMT to accommodate daily updates from India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. *Thank you for your understanding.

So the reports will be running everyday by 10.00 AM ET/ 7.00 AM PT for the day before the date of run. Eg: Report that runs on 06-29-2020 10.00 AM ET will be for the situational report for 06-28-2020. We apologize for the schedule update, our reports are heavily dependent on the schedule of the data sources.  

> **Important:** JHU announced that *"We have tried to Push updates to the repository at approximately 00:00 UTC every day. In order to accommodate reporting across the lower 48 states of the United States, we are moving this update forward in time to occur between 03:30 and 04:00 UTC (23:30 – 00:00 EDT)"*. So reports from 04-24-2020 will be printed at 1 AM EST. We apologize for the inconvenience, but it really is beyond our control.

> Jobs failed in the workflows at the data source, they were rerun at mightnight EST on 04/24, so 04/23 reports are available from 00.20 hrs EST on 04-24-2020.

> In depth India stats with state level confirmations, new confirmations, recoveries, active cases, deaths and new deaths are printed on reports on or after 04-19-2020. 

> Canada province level curves are added for the most affected provinces- Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia. It is printed for reports on and after 04-17-2020.

> Additional state and county level metrics for US as in: US Detailed State and County Level Curves., Top 50 US Counties with the Highest Cases and Deaths and Overall US Choropleth Map were added to the reports from 04-16-2020.

> In depth country stats of USA, Canada and Italy were modified to include additional metrics like NewConfirmations, NewDeaths, PercentIncrease and so on. These changes will reflect from reports printed on or after 04-10-2020.

> The report for 01-04-2020 was uploaded on 10.23 PM EST due to data unavailability for the day in the data sources.

> A new metric- Measuring Outbreak Velocity: 5 Day Lagging Average Doubling Time (Top 20 Countries with the Highest Cases) is printed on reports on and after 03-28-2020.

> In Depth Italy Stats (Region Wise Figures) are printed on and after 03-25-2020.

> Reports are printed at 9 PM EST from 03-21-2020 due to the source data cron which only runs at 8 PM EST everyday.

> Recovered cases and thereby Active cases (=Confirmed-Deaths-Recovered) are not printed on reports except for Italy. This is because countries widely under-report number of recovered cases and so tracking it has been stopped.
