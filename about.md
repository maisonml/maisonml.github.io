## About Maison ML

**Maison ML** was started by Dhivya Ravindran to serve as an everyday reference of data intense daily situation reports on the onset, progression and updates of the **2019- 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic**. The reports are updated everyday at 9 PM EST. If you would like additional metrics added to this report or would like further features added to this product, please send out an email to dhivyaravindran@gmail.com. 
<br>

The following are the product enhancements upcoming in the pipeline:

> Dedicated repository of helpline numbers for USA, Canada, India, UK and Italy.

The following were the changes made to the reports and/or product:

> Reports are printed at 9 PM EST from 03-21-2020 due to the source data cron which only runs at 8 PM EST everyday.
<br>

> In Depth USA Stats (State Wise Figures) has the following additional metrics added: ConfirmedCasesPerMillPopl, DeathsPerMillPopl and Infection Odds; these will reflect from the reports printed on or after 03-23-2020.
<br>

> Recovered cases and thereby Active cases (=Confirmed-Deaths-Recovered) are not printed on reports on or after 03-23-2020. This is because countries widely under-report number of recovered cases and so tracking it has been stopped.
