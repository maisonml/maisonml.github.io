### What is COVID-19?

**Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)** is an infectious disease caused by a virus which goes by the name: **severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)**. The disease was first identified in 2019 in **Wuhan, China**, and has since spread globally, resulting in the **2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic**. 

### How does it spread?

The infection is typically spread from one person to another via **respiratory droplets** produced during coughing and sneezing.

### What is the incubation period?

Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between **2 and 14 days**, with an average of five days.

### What are the signs and symptoms?

Although those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic, many develop flu-like symptoms including **fever, cough, and shortness of breath**.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be seen. Gastorintestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are seen in a minority of cases.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.

### How long does it take to recover?

Mild cases typically recover within **two weeks**, while those with severe or critical disease may take **three to six weeks** to recover. 

### How to protect yourself, your family and your community from the virus?

Because a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is not expected to become available until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of managing the COVID-19 pandemic is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as **flattening the epidemic curve** through various measures seeking to reduce the rate of new infections. 
Slowing the infection rate helps decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and provides more time for a vaccine and treatment to be developed.

Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection in locations with an outbreak of the disease are similar to those published for other coronaviruses: 

* Stay home, 
* Avoid travel and public activities, 
* Wash hands with soap and hot water often, 
* Practice good respiratory hygiene and 
* Avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.

**Social distancing** strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling mass gatherings.
According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/){:target="_blank"}, the use of masks is only recommended if a person is coughing or sneezing or when one is taking care of someone with a suspected infection.

To prevent transmission of the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/){:target="_blank"} in the United States recommends that infected individuals:

* Stay home except to get medical care, 
* Call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, 
* Wear a face mask when exposed to an individual or location of a suspected infection, 
* Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, 
* Regularly wash hands with soap and water and 
* Avoid sharing personal household items.

CDC also recommends that individuals **wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds**, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. 
It further recommended using an **alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 65% alcohol**, but only when soap and water are not readily available.

The World Health Organization [WHO](https://www.who.int/){:target="_blank"} advises individuals to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Spitting in public places also should be avoided.
